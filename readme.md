# Reverse Engineering: Epson Label printer protocol

This is the documentation for the reverse engineering of the Epson label
printer protocol according to Epson's Android iLabel app.

The protocol definition can be found in the [protocol.md](protocol.md).

Currrently this has only been verified using an Epson LW-C410 which is a
Bluetooth v1 device (8 byte status message). So a few things could not been
tested. If you have a device please open an issue.
